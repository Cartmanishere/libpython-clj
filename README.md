# libpython-clj

jna libpython bindings to the tech ecosystem.

If you have a production need right now, I strongly advise you to consider
[jep](https://github.com/ninia/jep).

This project is mean to explore what is possible using JNA.  This has a lot of
advantages over a [10,000 line C binding layer](https://github.com/ninia/jep/tree/master/src/main/c)
...if it works.
