# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and come in many forms.  Let's be polite, professional, and
keep this a place we want to be.


## Issues


Issues are best if they come with a test.  The exact version of python you are running
and your operating system, clojure version, java version, etc. if relevant will save
everyone time who reviews your issue.  Consider some form of:

1.  What I did
1.  What I expected to happen
1.  What actually happened


## Failing Tests


A public branch with failing tests of things that you would like to work is also a great idea.  Or just
more tests.  Things like:

>> are java lists and maps actually substitutable for python lists and dicts in python code and vice versa

are most likely ripe areas for tests and will greatly help with expectations and code portability.


## PR's


Shorter the PR, the less back and forth there will be and the more likely to be accepted.


## Documentation


Documentation is key but needs to be accurate and brief.  Incorrect documentation is
worse than no documentation.
