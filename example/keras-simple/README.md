# Simple Keras Example


Example source taken from [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/).


## Usage


```console
pip3 install tensorflow keras --user
```


Then, potentially check that everything is installed.  From python console:

```console
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import keras
Using TensorFlow backend.
>>>
```

## Virtual Environments


This was lightly tested with `python3 -m venv venv`.  Simply activate the virtual environment in the same console
before you launch the repl and things should work fine assuming the base python
executable versions line up.  Again, see readme if they do not in order to override the
version loaded.
