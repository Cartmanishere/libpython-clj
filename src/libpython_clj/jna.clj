;; Bugs and caveats: The destruction of modules and objects in modules is done in random
;; order; this may cause destructors (__del__() methods) to fail when they depend on
;; other objects (even functions) or modules. Dynamically loaded extension modules
;; loaded by Python are not unloaded. Small amounts of memory allocated by the Python
;; interpreter may not be freed (if you find a leak, please report it). Memory tied up
;; in circular references between objects is not freed. Some memory allocated by
;; extension modules may not be freed. Some extensions may not work properly if their
;; initialization routine is called more than once; this can happen if an application
;; calls Py_Initialize() and Py_Finalize() more than once.
